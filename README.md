# Stream-Example-Angular-Cli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

This is very basic example intended to accompany the [JavaScript Frontend Framework CLI Showdown](https://getstream.io/blog/javascript-framework-cli-showdown/) post on the Stream blog. For a more thorough Angular example, see the [stream-example-angular](https://github.com/getstream/stream-angular-example) project.

The project is pre-configured with a shared [Stream](https://getstream.io) account for testing purposes. You can learn more about Stream feeds, sign up for an account, and obtain your own App Id and Key at https://getstream.io/get_started.
